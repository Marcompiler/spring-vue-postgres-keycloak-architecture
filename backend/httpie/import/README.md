# Backend - HTTPie - Import

## Description

In HTTPie, it is possible to [import](https://httpie.io/docs/desktop/import) or [export](https://httpie.io/docs/desktop/export) requests to save/share/reuse them.

Here, these are **the requests I used to test** the proper functioning of the backend.

## How to Use

As described in [the official HTTPie documentation](https://httpie.io/docs/desktop/import), **you can import the export** [`httpie-collection-demo-api.json`](./httpie-collection-demo-api.json) provided here to verify that you have correctly run the backend.
