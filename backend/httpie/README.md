# Backend - HTTPie

## Description

Since the **backend is an API** with which our frontend communicates, you may want to **test the API without** necessarily deploying/running your **frontend** each time.

To do this, applications like [**HTTPie**](https://httpie.io/) can be helpful.

## How to Use

Start HTTPie or go [to the website](https://httpie.io/) to execute your test requests.

A set of requests testing the backend as developed so far is available in the "[`import`](./import/)" folder.
