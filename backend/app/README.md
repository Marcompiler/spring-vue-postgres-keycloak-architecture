# Backend - App

## Description

Here we are in **the heart of the architecture: the API**. It is at the center of all other elements in the chain: the database, the SSO, and the frontend.

This is therefore an **application** in **[Java](https://www.java.com/)**, using the **[Spring](https://spring.io/)** framework, and it aims to be a **REST API** but **without [hypermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)**.  
According to [the Richardson Maturity Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_Maturity_Model), this makes it a **[level 2 REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_Maturity_Model#Level_2:_HTTP_Verbs)**.

## How to Use

First of all, **make sure the database and the SSO are started**. The backend requires them to start properly.

Next, **several options** are available for **running** and **developing** this part. I personally usually use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (*Community Edition*).

Otherwise, you can directly run the application as-is using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) commands.

### Running with Maven

You can use the included "`mvnw`" to ensure you are using the same Maven version used during the development of this application.  
However, nothing prevents you from installing Maven on your machine and using it directly. In that case, you will use `mvn` instead of `mvnw` in the following commands.

1. First, **open your command prompt in this directory**.  
2. Then, **build and install the project**:

        ./mvnw clean install

3. Finally, **start the project**:

        ./mvnw spring-boot:run

4. Make a request to one of the backend endpoints using your browser, [HTTPie](../httpie/), or, if you have `curl`:

        curl http://localhost:8081/api/public

5. Verify that the previous request returns: "Hello public". The backend is now correctly deployed and running.

### Development

To develop the application, **please use an IDE** such as [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) (*with the corresponding Java extensions*), or any other IDE you feel comfortable with **as long as it supports Java**.

Most of the files here were generated by [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io), so you don't need to worry about them for the application to work.

**To start your development/understanding**, you can **directly dive** into the [**`main`**](./src/main/) directory.
