# Backend - App - Main - Resources

## Description

This is the **configuration** of the backend application.

Using [`application.properties`](./application.properties), it defines **properties to be applied for running** the application.

## How to Use

**As-is**, [`application.properties`](./application.properties) sets **all the parameters you need** to run the architecture **with default settings**.

However, **you can redefine the values** as you see fit for running as-is and/or for your own development.

Be careful: if you modify the values, **make sure to update them in the other elements** of the architecture as well!

*Note: If you want to **explore configuration possibilities**, you can refer to the [official Spring documentation on this topic](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/appendix/application-properties/index.html).*
