# Backend - App - Main

## Description

This is the directory where you will do most of your development. It is **divided into two** directories:

- [`java`](./java/) : contains **all the Java code** (*classes, controllers, etc.*).  
- [`resources`](./resources/) : contains **the application settings**.

## How to Use

Depending on what you want to do, you can:

- Continue **exploring the application** in [`the directory where it all starts`](./java/com/marcompiler/test_architecture_rest_jpa_oauth2/).  
- Check the **application configuration** in [`resources`](./resources/).
