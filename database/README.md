# Database

## Description

This is the [relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) which, in this case, will be [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). This is where structured data will be stored and accessed by the frontend through the backend.

## How to Use

You can explore the [Podman](./podman/) directory to see how to deploy your PostgreSQL database in just a few clicks.
