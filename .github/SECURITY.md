## Reporting a Vulnerability

**If you spot any vulnerability** in this repository, **please report it in the [issues](https://github.com/Marcompiler/spring-vue-postgres-keycloak-architecture/issues) with the label `security`**. This way, the issue can be resolved as quickly as possible.

**If I am unable to respond quickly enough** to vulnerabilities, **others will at least be able to notice them** by **checking the [labeled issues](https://github.com/Marcompiler/spring-vue-postgres-keycloak-architecture/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Asecurity)** and adapt their own code if needed.
