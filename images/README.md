# Images

## Description

Here are the images used in this project.

To create them, I used the following software:

- [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/)
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)

You will find them used throughout the repository.

## How to use

Their sole purpose is to illustrate explanations and present the architecture.

It's up to you to decide how to use them (*visual reminders, inspiration, etc.*).
