# Frontend - App - Src - Views

## Description

This is where you will find **the application views**, in other words, the pages accessible within the application.

There are two views:

- [`AboutView.vue`](./AboutView.vue): **The "About" page**, generated by Vue.JS and left **untouched**.
- [`HomeView.vue`](./HomeView.vue): **The home page**, generated by Vue.JS, to which we have **added our "Api[...]" components** and a **logout button**.

## How to use

If you want to **display** **additional components/elements** in the display, **this is where** it happens.

You can also **add new views**. In this case, **don't forget** to **reference** them in [`router`](../router/).
