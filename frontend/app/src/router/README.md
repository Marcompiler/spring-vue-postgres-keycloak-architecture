# Frontend - App - Src - Router

## Description

The router contains **all the paths defined for each page of the application**.

All of the application's views are accessible via a URL, a path leading to the corresponding page. The router is where the link between this page and the chosen path is made.

This router was generated by Vue.JS and has been left untouched.

## How to use

**In the indexer** "[`index.js`](./index.js)", you can **add/remove associations between a path, a name, and a page** (*the corresponding component*).

So you have an example of an association where the home page is loaded when the application starts and where the "about" page is "[lazy load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading)", in other words, it is only loaded on demand.
