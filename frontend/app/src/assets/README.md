# Frontend - App - Src - Assets

## Description

This directory contains all the media and CSS/JavaScript files of your application.

This is where you will, for example, place the local images displayed on your website.

## How to Use

### Media

All media files (photo/video/etc.) should be stored here. You can then reference them in your components, for example in pure HTML with the "`img`" tag.

### CSS

Do you need to apply a specific style within a component? Or do you simply want to split your main CSS into multiple CSS files for better organization? This is also where you can create your CSS files before referencing them in the target components.

### JavaScript

In the case of Vue.JS, your JS scripts can usually remain within their respective components. However, if you want to, for example, share a script across the entire application, you can create a JS file here and then reference it at the root of your page structure in [App.vue](../App.vue).
