# Frontend - App - Src - Components - Icons

## Description

This directory is one of those generated by Vue and was left untouched.

However, it can serve as inspiration for organizing your components: there are the "basic" ones in the [parent directory](../), and there are those meant to be only icons, like the ones here.

## How to Use

Given the structure proposed by Vue, you can keep this directory for your "icon" components or simply delete it if it turns out to be unnecessary for your project.
