# Frontend - App - Src - Components

## Description

Vue.JS applications are made up of *components* that are reusable and modular throughout the application. The homepage (*which itself is also a component*) therefore contains a set of components named "`Api[...]`", each with a specific purpose to test this architecture.

The table below lists each of these `Api[...]` components along with their purpose and a complexity rating from 1 to 5 (*proportional to the number of architectural elements involved in achieving the goal*):  

| Name | Purpose | Complexity |
| :---: | :--- | :---: |
| [`ApiAuthData`](./ApiAuthData.vue) | Test authentication and retrieval of data requiring authentication. | 2 |
| [`ApiAuthDataWithForm`](./ApiAuthDataWithForm.vue) | Test authentication and retrieval of data based on a client-side form. | 3 |
| [`ApiGetUserById`](./ApiGetUserById.vue) | Verify that a user has been properly registered in the backend (*and not SSO*) using the ID generated at registration. | 4 |
| [`ApiGetUserBySub`](./ApiGetUserBySub.vue) | Verify that a user has been properly registered in the backend (*and not SSO*) using their `sub` from the SSO at the time of registration. | 5 |
| [`ApiGetUserBySurname`](./ApiGetUserBySurname.vue) | Verify that a user has been properly registered in the backend (*and not SSO*) using the nickname chosen at registration. | 4 |
| [`ApiGetUsers`](./ApiGetUsers.vue) | Verify the users registered in the backend (*and not SSO*). | 4 |
| [`ApiPublicData`](./ApiPublicData.vue) | Verify the connection between frontend and backend by calling a public endpoint of the backend. | 1 |
| [`ApiUserRegister`](./ApiUserRegister.vue) | Register the user logged in through SSO within the backend, dynamically assigning their SSO `sub` in the backend along with a chosen nickname. | 5 |
| [`ApiUserRoleAdmin`](./ApiUserRoleAdmin.vue) | Test assignment of "admin" roles coming from SSO, which are used by the corresponding backend endpoint. | 3 |
| [`ApiUserRoleUser`](./ApiUserRoleUser.vue) | Test assignment of "user" roles coming from SSO, which are used by the corresponding backend endpoint. | 3 |

Note: *As a reminder, the "backend" application refers to the "server-side," while the "frontend" refers to the "client-side."*

## How to Use

All `Api[...]` components are intended to test the architecture. In their current state, they help you verify that you have correctly deployed all elements of the architecture.

If you want to develop additional components, you can use these as a reference.

The other components, [`HelloWorld.vue`](./HelloWorld.vue), [`TheWelcome.vue`](./TheWelcome.vue), and [`WelcomeItem.vue`](./WelcomeItem.vue), are components generated by Vue during the initialization of the project.
